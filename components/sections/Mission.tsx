            Growing up in a hotel family and spending my career in hospitality,
            I've always been passionate about creating genuine connections
            between travelers and the hotels that fit their needs. That's why I
            started Linnkerâ€”a platform that aims to simplify hotel bookings
            and bring transparency back to the industry.
